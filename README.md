* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account
* Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)

## Installation

Add this role to `requirements.yml`:

```yaml
- src: TypistTech.trellis-cloudflare-origin-ca # Case-sensitive!
  version: 0.5.1 # Check for latest version!
```

Run `$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` to install this new role.

## Role Variables

```yaml
# group_vars/<environment>/vault.yml
# This file should be encrypted. See: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/
##########################################################################

# Cloudflare Origin CA Key
## Not to confuse with Cloudflare Global API Key
## See: https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ca-encryption-origin/#iiobtainyourcertificateapitoken
vault_cloudflare_origin_ca_key: v1.0-xxxxxxxxxxx

# group_vars/<environment>/main.yml
###################################

# Indicates the desired package state.
# `latest` ensures that the latest version is installed.
# `present` does not update if already installed.
# Choices: present|latest
# Default: latest
cfca_package_state: present

# group_vars/<environment>/wordpress_sites.yml
##############################################

wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    # Your Cloudflare account must own all these domains
    site_hosts:
      - canonical: example.com
        redirects:
          - hi.example.com
          - hello.another-example.com
    ssl:
      # SSL must be enabled
      enabled: true
      # OCSP stapling must be disabled
      stapling_enabled: false
      # Use this role to generate Cloudflare Origin CA certificate
      provider: cloudflare-origin-ca
    # The followings are optional
    cloudflare_origin_ca:
      # Number of days for which the issued cert will be valid. Acceptable options are: 7, 30, 90, 365 (1y), 730 (2y), 1095 (3y), 5475 (15y).
      # Default: 5475
      days: 7
      # List of fully-qualified domain names to include on the certificate as Subject Alternative Names.
      # Default: All canonical and redirect domains
      # In the above example: example.com, hi.example.com, hello.another-example.com
      hostnames:
        - example.com
        - '*.example.com'
        - '*.another-example.com'
      # Key size in bits to use for the generated key pair (Acceptable sizes: rsa: 2048|3072|4096, ecdsa: 256|384|521)
      # Default: 256
      key_size: 3072
      # Type of key pair to generate, either RSA or ECDSA. (rsa|ecdsa)
      # Default: ecdsa
      key_type: rsa
```

## Hacking Trellis' Playbook

Add this role to `server.yml` **immediately after** `role: wordpress-setup`:

```yaml
roles:
    # Some other Trellis roles ...
    - { role: wordpress-setup, tags: [wordpress, wordpress-setup, letsencrypt, cloudflare-origin-ca] }
    - { role: TypistTech.trellis-cloudflare-origin-ca, tags: [cloudflare-origin-ca, wordpress-setup], when: sites_using_cloudflare_origin_ca | count }
    # Some other Trellis roles ...
```

Note: `role: wordpress-setup` is tagged with `cloudflare-origin-ca`.

## Nginx Includes

This role templates Nginx SSL directives out to `{{ nginx_path }}/includes.d/{{ item.key }}/cloudflare-origin-ca.conf`. Trellis includes this file [here](https://github.com/roots/trellis/blob/4cd1be12a8cfacf78af3a9a1302bea153f80e459/roles/wordpress-setup/templates/wordpress-site.conf.j2#L106) and [here](https://github.com/roots/trellis/pull/879/files) by default, no action needed.

If you using [Nginx child templates](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/nginx-includes/#child-templates), add this line into your server blocks:
```
include includes.d/{{ item.key }}/cloudflare-origin-ca.conf;
```

## Common Errors

### No site is using Cloudflare Origin CA

Obviously, you should not run this role when you don't use Cloudflare Origin CA.

### `vault_cloudflare_origin_ca_key` is not defined

Encrypt your Cloudflare Origin CA Key in `group_vars/<environment>/vault.yml`. See [role variables](#role-variables).

### `example.com` is using Cloudflare Origin CA but OCSP stapling is enabled

> ... you're trying to staple OCSP responses with Origin CA. Right now OCSP is not supported with Origin CA, so you should remove the ssl_staping directive for the host that you're using the Origin CA cert on...
>
> --- Cloudflare Support

Cloudflare Origin CA doesn't support OCSP stapling. Disable OCSP stapling for all sites using Cloudflare Origin CA. See [role variables](#role-variables).

### Nginx directories not included

Make sure you have [roots/trellis@f2b8107](https://github.com/roots/trellis/commit/f2b81074c83475837e544a8aa5c3e909e760aa8a) or later.

## Known Issues

**Help Wanted!** Pull requests are welcome.

- Cloudflare Origin CA key is logged even `no_log` is `true`. It happens when Ansible verbosity is high enough.

## FAQ

### Why use Cloudflare Origin CA?

Short answer: To keep connection between Cloudflare and your severs private and secure from tampering.

Long answer:
> CloudFlare’s Flexible SSL mode is the default for CloudFlare sites on the Free plan. Flexible SSL mode means that traffic from browsers to CloudFlare will be encrypted, but traffic from CloudFlare to a site's origin server will not be. To take advantage of our [Full and Strict SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl) mode—which encrypts the connection between CloudFlare and the origin server—it’s necessary to install a certificate on the origin server.
>
> Cloudflare Blog - [Origin Server Connection Security with Universal SS ](https://blog.cloudflare.com/origin-server-connection-security-with-universal-ssl/)

### What are the benefits of Cloudflare Origin CA over Let's Encrypt?

To get certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), you have to first disable Cloudflare because Cloudflare hides actual server IPs and make Let's Encrypt challenges fail. Using Cloudflare Origin CA simplify the troubles.

### What are the benefits of Cloudflare Origin CA over other public certificates?

See [Introducing CloudFlare Origin CA](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ca-encryption-origin/#whataretheincrementalbenefitsoforigincaoverpubliccertificates) on Cloudflare blog.

### Why use 256-bit ECDSA key as default?

>I assume you would like to setup [Authenticated Origin Pulls](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204899617-Authenticated-Origin-Pulls) with Cloudflare. I would recommend ECDSA, as elliptic curves provide the same security with less computational overhead.
>
>Find out more about [ECDSA: The digital signature algorithm of a better internet](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/)
>The above article also mentioned that: According to the [ECRYPT II recommendations](http://www.keylength.com/en/3/) on key length, a 256-bit elliptic curve key provides as much protection as a 3,248-bit asymmetric key.Typical RSA keys in website certificates are 2048-bits. So, I think going with 256-bits ECDSA will be a good choice.
>
> --- Cloudflare Support

If you insist to use RSA keys, make sure you set `key_size` to at least `2048`.
